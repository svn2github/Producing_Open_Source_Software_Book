  <!-- This is an egregious kluge.  Since I don't know how to reference 
       the text from <edition> element above and have it show up in
       the right place in all the output formats, I just crowbar a
       redundant version into the copyright section here.  At least
       it'll show up that way.  It looks good in HTML and PDF; build
       problems with EPUB are preventing me from checking that, but
       based on an old EPUB I think it should be fine there too.  

       So basically, as long as you have no morals nor sense of taste,
       this solution is just fine. -->
