  <!-- For some reason, the cdata in the 'edition' element doesn't
       seem to be included in the output anywhere.  At least, if it
       is, I haven't found it.  <shrug>  That's why we kluge the
       version into the 'copyright' element later on.  But let's still
       substitute in the right VC-based version number here, just in
       case 'edition' ever does start showing up. -->

  <!-- This is an egregious kluge.  Since I don't know how to reference 
       the text from <edition> element above and have it show up in
       the right place in all the output formats, I just crowbar a
       redundant version into the copyright section here.  At least
       it'll show up that way.  It looks good in HTML and PDF; build
       problems with EPUB are preventing me from checking that, but
       based on an old EPUB I think it should be fine there too.  

       So basically, as long as you have no morals nor sense of taste,
       this solution is just fine. -->
